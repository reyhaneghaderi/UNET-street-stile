# Image Segmentation with U-Net

This project implements U-Net architectures for semantic segmentation, comparing a vanilla U-Net with a regularized U-Net to evaluate the effect of dropout and data augmentation on generalization.
Project Objectives

# Implement U-Net from scratch for image segmentation.

- Compare baseline (vanilla) vs. regularized model performance.

- Apply dropout and augmentation to reduce overfitting.

- Visualize training curves and segmentation masks.

- Draw insights on model generalization and robustness.

  # Technologies Used

  - Python

- PyTorch / TensorFlow/Keras (depending on notebook)

- NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image
