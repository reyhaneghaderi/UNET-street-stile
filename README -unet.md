# deep-image-segmentation

A collection of deep learning implementations for image segmentation using the U-Net architecture.

## Repository Contents

- **vallina UNET**  
  Notebook demonstrating U-Net model training and evaluation on custom datasets.

- **regularization UNET**  
  Supplemental notebook with additional preprocessing and inference scripts.


   ```

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Organize your images and masks in separate folders, for example:
     ```
     data/
       images/
       masks/
     ```
   - Update the notebook paths to point to your dataset directories.

2. **Training**  
   - Open `vallina UNET`  
   - Run all cells to train the U-Net model on your data.

3. **Inference**  
   - Use the inference section in either notebook to generate segmentation masks on new images.

## Requirements

- Python  
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the notebook)  
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
